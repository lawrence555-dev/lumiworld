# LumiWorld Teacher & Parent Guide

Welcome to **LumiWorld**! This comprehensive guide is designed for both teachers and parents. LumiWorld is an 8-week interactive curriculum that integrates **STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics)** and **SEL (Social Emotional Learning)** to guide children aged 3-6 in exploring the world, developing logic, and cultivating a care for the environment.

## 🌟 Core Pedagogical Goals

This system is more than just a classification game. it incorporates professional pedagogical designs:

1.  **Adaptive Scaffolding**:
    - The system dynamically adjusts based on the child's performance. If a child encounters difficulties, the system provides visual cues (pulse animations) or disables incorrect options to help them succeed, ensuring a sense of achievement.
2.  **Multi-sensory Learning**:
    - Every item includes icons, text, and multilingual audio to strengthen the connection between visual and auditory learning.
3.  **Science of Reading Foundation**:
    - Basic phonics awareness is integrated into scientific exploration (e.g., connecting letters and sounds in the anatomy module).
4.  **Data-Driven Feedback**:
    - Through the star rating system, teachers and parents can clearly track the child's mastery of classification logic.

## 🎮 Game Mechanics & Design Details

### Interaction
- **Drag & Drop**: Develops fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.
- **Real-time Positive Feedback**: Colorful confetti and encouraging sounds for correct answers; gentle prompts for incorrect ones.

### Intelligent Assistance
- **Two Errors**: The correct zone pulses to guide the student.
- **Three Errors**: The incorrect zone is automatically disabled, allowing the child to focus on the correct target, reducing frustration.

## 💡 Suggestions for Teachers and Parents

### For Teachers (In Class)
1.  **Group Exploration**: Let 2-3 children work together and discuss "Why is this living?" before dragging.
2.  **Thematic Integration**: Decorate the classroom with related cards or specimens (e.g., growing beans during Week 6).
3.  **Post-game Discussion**: Invite children to share which item surprised them most to train expression skills.

### For Parents (At Home)
1.  **Real-world Connection**: After the "Huge vs Tiny" week, hunt for huge and tiny items around the house together.
2.  **Support Thinking**: If the child is stuck, ask guided questions like "Does a cat need to grow?" instead of giving the answer.
3.  **Multilingual Environment**: Switch between languages to let children naturally encounter foreign pronunciations.
