# Project Proposal: LumiWorld - Integrated Pre-K STEAM & Early Literacy Initiative

**Curriculum System:** US-Based (Aligned with US Common Core & NGSS)  
**Target Grade:** Pre-Kindergarten (Ages 4-5)  
**Unit Theme:** Sharing the Planet (Environmental Stewardship)  
**Format:** Web-Based Interactive Curriculum

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This initiative aims to support this semester's core inquiry unit by integrating **STEAM education** with **Early Literacy** through digital technology. LumiWorld is not just a game; it is a supplementary learning platform designed in accordance with CCSS (Common Core State Standards) and NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards).

Through an 8-week immersive experience, we transform abstract ecological concepts into concrete interactive tasks, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for students entering Kindergarten.

## 2. Curriculum Alignment
The course design directly maps to key US early childhood education standards, ensuring seamless integration between digital learning and classroom instruction:

### 🔬 Science (Based on NGSS Standards)
- **K-LS1-1:** Describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.
- **K-ESS3-3:** Communicate solutions that will reduce the impact of humans on the land, water, air, and/or other living things in the local environment.

### 🔢 Math (Based on CCSS Math Standards)
- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.CC.B.4:** Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.
- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.MD.A.2:** Directly compare two objects with a measurable attribute in common, to see which object has "more of"/"less of" the attribute.
- **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.G.A.1:** Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes.

### 📖 English Language Arts (Based on CCSS ELA Standards)
- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.K.1.D:** Recognize and name all upper- and lowercase letters of the alphabet.
- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.K.3.A:** Demonstrate basic-level knowledge of one-to-one letter-sound correspondences (Phonics).
- **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.5.A:** Sort common objects into categories to gain a sense of the concepts the categories represent.

## 3. Scope and Sequence (8-Week Roadmap)
We employ an **"Inquiry-Based Learning"** model, guiding students to transition from observers to active participants.

| Week | Theme | Cross-Curricular Focus | Key Vocab |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **W1** | **Scientific Classification** | [Science & Logic] Distinguishing Living vs. Non-Living. Standard: Observing & classifying attributes. | Living, Non-living, Rock, Cat |
| **W2** | **Introduction to Anatomy** | [ELA & Geometry] Guppy body part puzzle. Standard: Geometric shapes & Letter F (Phonics). | Fish, Fin, Tail, F (Letter) |
| **W3** | **Number Sense & Needs** | [Math] Counting & feeding tasks (1-20). Standard: One-to-one Correspondence. | Count, Eat, Food, 1-20 |
| **W4** | **Comparative Measurement** | [Math & Bio] Elephant vs. Mouse: Size comparison. Standard: Comparative attributes. | Big, Small, Heavy, Elephant |
| **W5** | **Habitat Exploration** | [Science & ELA] Eagle & aerial perspective. Standard: Spatial Prepositions. | Up, Down, Sky, Eagle |
| **W6** | **Botany Basics** | [Science & Logic] Plant life cycle sequencing. Standard: Logical sequencing. | Seed, Grow, Sun, Water |
| **W7** | **Environmental Science** | [Social Studies] Impact of pollution on marine life. Standard: Cause and Effect. | Trash, Clean, Dirty, Dolphin |
| **W8** | **Capstone Project** | [STEAM Integration] Multi-tasking ecosystem management. Standard: Executive Function. | Care, Help, Planet, Hero |

## 4. Pedagogical Approach
To meet the expectations of elite US educational systems, our design incorporates the following strategies:

### 1. Differentiated Instruction
Recognizing that not all 4-year-olds progress at the same rate, the system includes an **"Adaptive Engine"**:
- **Scaffolding:** When a student struggles with a math task, the system automatically reduces options (e.g., from 3 to 2) and provides visual hints rather than just giving the answer.

### 2. Phonemic Awareness & Sight Words (Science of Reading)
In the ELA modules, we emphasize **"Letter-Sound Correspondence"** rather than rote memorization.
- **Mechanism:** Students must hear the initial sound of "Fish" /f/ and find the letter 'F' to complete the puzzle. This aligns with the core principles of early reading development.

### 3. Social Emotional Learning (SEL)
Informed by the CASEL framework, we integrate empathy education in Weeks 7-8.
- When a dolphin is trapped in trash, it displays "Sad" emotions, changing to "Happy" after being cleaned. This teaches students to recognize emotions and cultivate empathy for the environment.

---

## 5. Assessment & Data Insights
The system provides **Formative Assessment** data similar to established educational reports:
- **Mastery Tracking:** Has the student mastered "Counting 1-20"? (Yes / In Progress / Needs Support)
- **Engagement Metrics:** Time spent on "Logical Sequencing" tasks, helping educators identify individual student interests and strengths.

## 6. Note to Educators
Dear Educators,

LumiWorld was designed to be a powerful extension of your classroom teaching. We understand that in a US-based educational framework, cultivating a child's **Inquisitive Mind** is far more important than simple knowledge acquisition.

There is no pressure of a "standard answer" here. Instead, we encourage children to "Try, Fail, and Adjust"—the very essence of **Scientific Inquiry**. We look forward to building a seamless learning ecosystem together with your school.
